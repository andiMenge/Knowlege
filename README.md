### Docker for Mac and no_proxy env var
`ENV no_proxy=foo` in a dockerfile gets overwritten by proxy and no_proxy conf in the **docker-engine** at least for macOS

- Avoid beeing PID 1 because of process SIGNAL handling. Use `tini` or `dumb_init`
- Listen for SIGTERM or set STOPSIGNAL in the Dockerfile

run `/bin/update-ca-trust` to update system CA's
